# Authorizatiion of request with AWS MediaPackage OriginEndpoint with Terraform

## I'll demonstrate the creation of MediaPackage origin endpoint with Terraform and CDN authorization, since there is no such resource of terraform that does create it!
 This will enhances security by ensuring that only requests with valid and authorized identifiers can access and distribute media content.


 
```bash
terraform init

to be continued
```


## This is the process we'll achieve.
